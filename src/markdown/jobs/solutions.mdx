## Solutions Engineer

We believe that today's "digital identity" is fundamentally flawed. There are
too many profiles, registration screens, passwords, privacy violations, data
leaks, phishing attacks, and data mining operations out there. Our vision is to
make the internet more secure and private with better software, open-source, and
open knowledge.

Ory is the largest open-source authentication and authorization (login,
registration, MFA, permissions, OAuth2) ecosystem and community in the
world. We develop open-source software and use it to build a scalable,
easy-to-use, and secure cloud platform. You will talk to customers to understand
their use case, prototype solutions, run proof-of-concepts to demonstrate value,
and help them move to production.

### Overview

- **Position type:** Full time
- **Location**: Munich, Germany / Remote (Timezone CET ± 3H)
- **Components**: Ory Cloud Console, Ory Open Source

- Become an expert at using the Ory Cloud and Ory Open Source products.
- Work with the Product, Engineering, and Sales teams to advocate for our
  customers.
- Collaborate with the Ory Open Source community to build and expand the Ory
  Open Source ecosystem.
- Help set the tone for future hires and develop the sales and solutions team.

### We’re looking for someone who has

- A bachelor’s Degree in an analytical or technical subject field or equivalent
  experience.
- Experience at a SaaS provider or working with open source products with a
  commercial cloud offering.
- Excellent scripting knowledge (e.g. BASH, Python, Ruby, Perl)
- Familiarity with at least one open source database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Strong attention to detail, communication, and writing skills. Fluent written
  and spoken English skills; any other languages are a plus.
- Prior experience in a communication-related role is a plus.
