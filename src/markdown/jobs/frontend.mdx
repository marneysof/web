## Frontend Software Engineer

We believe that today's "digital identity" is fundamentally flawed. There are
too many profiles, registration screens, passwords, privacy violations, data
leaks, phishing attacks, and data mining operations out there. Our vision is to
make the internet more secure and private with better software, open-source, and
open knowledge.

Ory is the largest open-source authentication and authorization (login,
registration, MFA, permissions, OAuth2) ecosystem and community in the
world. We develop open-source software and use it to build a scalable,
easy-to-use, and secure cloud platform. You will work on one of the industry's
most important code-bases, having a positive impact on hundreds of millions of
people worldwide.
